# Basics of Powerpoint through Rmarkdown

You can use most of the regular Rmarkdown features and formatting:

- Dot points

- **Bold**, _Italics_ and ~~strikethrough~~

## Equations


Equations are supported out of the box.  You can put inline equations inside dollar signs, e.g. `$\alpha + \beta$` renders as $\alpha + \beta$.   Display style works with double dollar signs: 

<span>`$`</span><span>`$`</span>`\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i`<span>`$`</span><span>`$`</span>
$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$
For multi-line equations you can use <span>`\`</span>`begin{align} ...  `</span>`\`</span>`end{align}`
\begin{align}
\bar{X} & = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_n \nonumber \\
& = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i \label{good-eq}
\end{align}
Unfortunately we don't appear to be able to reference equations.

# Code

Blocks of code can be displayed as per normal:

```{r}
sample(1:10, size = 5)
```


And plots (you will likely need to increase `dpi` chunk option):

```{r plot, dpi = 300}
plot(faithful)
```
